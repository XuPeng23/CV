This project provide an approach to detect differences in two similar images which may be different in perspectivesï¼Œgray levels or scales.
To correctly detect the differences, it is necessary to find the transformations between the two images.
So, in this project I used SIFT to find the Homography between the two images. With Homography, we can compare the corresponding points between the two images.
